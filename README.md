# CrabGPT

just a simple rustacean chatbot powered by gpt-3.5.  simply say "yo crabby..." in the chat and a bot smarter than a 4th grader will respond annoyingly to you.

to get this up and running, you need a file named `.bot.env` stored in the root directory of the project when you compile it.

your `.bot.env` file should like this:
```toml
openai_api_key="your openai api key"
discord_app_id=your discord app id
discord_token="your discord bot token"
```
